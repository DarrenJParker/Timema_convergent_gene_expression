# Timema_convergent_gene_expression

This is the repository for the collected scripts used in the study:

>Parker, D. J., Bast, J., Jalvingh, K., Dumas, Z., Robinson-Rechavi, M., Schwander, T. 2019. Sex-biased gene expression is masculinized in asexual females. 

Currently under review.

# Components

## DATA

* Contains read counts, GO terms, dN/dS and pN/pS estimates for input to the scripts below. 

## SCRIPTS

### Differential expression analyses


### GO term analyses


### pN/pS and dN/dS analyses


### Additional scripts


# Infomation on running scripts

## General 

* All scripts should be run from the directory they are in. Output directories will be created to store output as the code is run. 
* All python scripts were made using python 3.5. All contain help information which can be displayed by specifying no command line arguments.

## To identify sex-biased genes
